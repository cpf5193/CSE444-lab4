2.1: 
Join:
     -I implemented join using both a nested loop and a hash join. The hash
     join is used for the = operator.
2.2:
IntegerAggregator: 
     -An IntegerAggregator uses two maps to keep track of the accumulated value
      and the number of tuples read for each unique groupby value. Operators 
      that have a group-by value of NO_GROUPING are represented by maps with 
      a single null key.
     -The aggregator's tupleDesc is set with specific column names the first 
      time a tuple is merged into the aggregator. 

StringAggregator:
      -A StringAggregator uses a map from group-by fields to number of tuples
       processed. Similarly to IntegerAggregator, operators with no grouping 
       have a single null hash key.
      -The tupleDesc of a StringAggregator has the same rules as an 
       IntegerAggregator

BufferPool:
	-evictPage() is implemented with a least-recently-used policy, using an
	 ArrayList to keep track of the pages in the buffer. On getPage, the 
	 BufferPool will either move the affected page to the front of the LRU
	 list or add the new page to the front of the list. If a page needs to
	 be evicted, the last page in the list will be deleted, and the new page
	 will be added to the front.
     
2. No changes to API

3. writePage is not yet implemented

4. I spent about 50 hours on this assignment. 45 were spent on part 1.

   Difficult/Confusing Sections:
   -Did not realize for a long time that IntegerAggregator should still be able
    to be grouped by a String attribute.
   -Figuring out how to implement the Join iterator so that all the components 
    were open and the children aggregators would not reset at the wrong times 
   -Bit manipulation to set a dirty or clean bit -- I spent about 4 hours trying
    to figure out the mask until I realized I could use XOR.
   -Making sequential scan fast. Even query 1 takes over 2 seconds

Runtimes:

Query 1: 2.16 Seconds
Query 2: 5.18 Seconds
Query 3: 7.97 Seconds
